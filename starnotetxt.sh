# This script is intended to be used to create special, emphasized, 
# text blocks for use in my note_YY-MM-DD[a-z].txt files. 
# The script does part of the fomatting for you in order to produce text like this:
#
#    *****************************************************************"
#    **                                                             **"
#    **  Some special text should go here. Copy and paste for       **"
#    **  additional lines as needed.                                **"
#    **                                                             **"
#    *****************************************************************"
#
# The block is created to be 65 characters wide. 
# It is indented by 4 spaces, and should have >=2 spaces of whitespace padding
# between all edges.
