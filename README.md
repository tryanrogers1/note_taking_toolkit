# note_taking_toolkit

This directory includes 3 different scripts for creating and organizing personal note files: 
1. newnote.sh: Main script, produces time-stamped but otherwise blank note files with sequential names.
2. starnote.sh: Simple text-based annotation/embellishments.
3. compile_notebook.sh: Script that searches your file system for notes generated by "newnote.sh", and concatenates them according to the chosen rule.

I also recommend some bash aliases to assist executing these scripts. Full descriptions of the scripts and aliases are found here on my website:
